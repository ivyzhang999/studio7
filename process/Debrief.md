# Summarize Highlights from Prep Material (Technician)

- Spend approximately 10-15 minutes summarizing highlights from the prep material.
- Do ***NOT*** use outside resources except where/when noted.  The answers should be based only on the group's knowledge.
- Be sure to discuss the content with your group and that everyone agrees on the answers.
- Answers can be brief/informal.

***Q1. Particle supports three major concepts for communication with devices on their platform, variables, functions, and streams.  Give a brief description of what you think each does (either based on your reading or a well-reasoned guess based on the name):***

1. Get: used to retrieve the value of a variable
1. Post: a function that sets a value
1. Stream: a low level way of connecting to another component.


***Q2. Many IoT platforms rely on the publish-subscribe model of communication. Describe what you think publish-subscribe means in your own words.***
  The publish-subscribe model refers to how a publisher categorizes data into classes without directly sending data to anything else. A subscriber finds the classes it needs and takes data from the classes. The publisher does not know which subscribers are getting its data.
